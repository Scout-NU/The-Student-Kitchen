<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Originally started as an afterschool club in 2023, The Student Kitchen was founded to provide hands-on culinary programming. We started as an afterschool club leading students through recipes and helping expand their culinary knowledge. Since then, The Student Kitchen has grown to provide classes for over 200 students and has served over 1,000 guests, including families, students, and school staff.</p>
<p>In June 2025 The Student Kitchen received the <strong><a href="https://www.idealist.org/en/action-incubator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idealist Action Incubator and Communitas America</a></strong> grant to jumpstart this work. We currently run several ongoing workshop series, as well as food demos and catering for community organizations. Our partners include <strong><a href="https://bushwickayudamutua.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bushwick Ayuda Mutua (BAM)</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://collectivefocus.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collective Focus</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.aafe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asian Americans for Equity</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.fihsnyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flushing International High School</a></strong>, and others.</p>

<h2>About Ben</h2>
<p>Ben Averbuch began working in Boston Public Schools, and then as a 9th grade history teacher in Brooklyn. During his time teaching, he noticed a stark lack of home economics (Food Consumer Sciences) programs, as well as a lack of nutritional and health education. He developed an afterschool club to work with students and build their confidence in the kitchen. In 2023 he founded the Student Kitchen.</p>
<p>For the summer 2025 season, Ben also worked as the Community Food Educator for <strong><a href="https://randallsisland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randall's Island Park Alliance</a></strong>, leading cooking workshops and serving samples at a local food pantry. Ben currently runs cooking programs both through The Student Kitchen as well as partner organizations such as <strong><a href="https://www.bronxeats.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bronx Eats</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://beazersgardenworkshops.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beazer's Gardens</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://greenbeetz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Beetz</a></strong>. He also works as an instructor for <strong><a href="https://www.culikid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Culikid</a></strong>, an organization devoted to providing cooking and skills-based workshops to neurodivergent students.</p>
